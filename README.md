## **Why did I build this?**
Horiseon, a marketing agency, needed to ensure that their codebase for their website met accessibility standards. The agency provided me with their working codebase requesting minor modifications, improved formatting, and a clean up (consolidation) of the index.html and style.css files. Once complete, the website would be optimized for search engines as well as Horiseon's customers.
